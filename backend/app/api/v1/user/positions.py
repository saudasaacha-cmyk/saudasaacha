        carry). Returning `margin_used` for NRML would reprint the intraday
        lock and hide the CF gate the owner asked for.

    market order for the trade's remaining (FIFO-leftover) quantity, NOT

    Why this is critical (was a production bug):
      The earlier implementation used `min(t.quantity, |p.quantity|)`,
      which over-closed whenever the trade had been partially consumed
      by a prior closing leg AND the user later pyramided more lots on
      top. Example:
          BUY 5 (T1) → LONG 5
          SELL 2     → partial close, LONG 3 (T1 leftover = 3 via FIFO)
          BUY 4 (T3) → LONG 7 (active rows: T1=3, T3=4)
          User clicks "Close" on T1 (UI shows 3 lots)
              old code: close_qty = min(5, 7) = 5 → over-closed by 2
              new code: close_qty = min(leftover_for_T1=3, 7) = 3 ✓

    shortfall that has to be cleaned up by hand.
