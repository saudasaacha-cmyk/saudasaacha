# and run multiple sweeps on a single event loop — exactly the 3-shards-on-one-
# worker case that starved the loop (3s+ `ltp_ms`, 14s `risk_enforcer_tick_overrun`).
# This per-PROCESS gate caps a worker at one risk shard and HARD-EXCLUDES the
# feed leader (already saturated by the 0.1s tick fanout — never run risk there),
# so the N shards fan out across N distinct HTTP backend workers.
#
# SAFETY (correctness > balance): if a shard stays denied for a few poll cycles
# — fewer live workers than shards, e.g. after a crash — the gate relaxes so the
# shard is NEVER left un-enforced (which would mean no SL/TP/stop-out for those
# users). The per-shard Redis lock still guarantees exactly one runner, so a
# relaxed attempt only ever wins a genuinely unclaimed shard. All logic here is

# ── Middleware ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# IMPORTANT: Starlette `add_middleware` PREPENDS to the stack — the
# LAST one registered runs FIRST on the incoming request. So everything
# below is in "innermost-first" order: CORSMiddleware/GZip/TrustedHost
# are registered first (they end up as inner layers), then the dynamic
# branding CORS middleware is registered LAST so it becomes the
# OUTERMOST layer and intercepts the OPTIONS preflight before the
# static CORSMiddleware (which only knows our own origins) can 400 it.
# Before this swap, tenant custom domains (e.g. stockcafe.live) hit
# CORSMiddleware first, got rejected without ACAO, and never reached
# the branding lookup — so every branded login page failed with a
# CORS preflight error and fell back to the platform default.

# custom_domain origins through (the regular CORSMiddleware above
# can't see DB rows, so it would 403 a request from broker_a.com
# even when broker_a.com is a legitimate, READY-status tenant).
# Cached in-process for 60 s — refreshed lazily on the first request
# after the TTL expires. Idempotent and tolerant of DB outages
# (falls back to "no extra origins" when the lookup fails).
# MUST be registered AFTER CORSMiddleware so it ends up outermost.
