    # its own upstream's ticks, so tick_loop / poller naturally act on just
    # their group; `mdlive` + `market:tick` writes never overlap (numeric vs
    # symbol tokens); the pending-order dedup lock prevents any double-fire.

        Development / staging are intentionally exempt so local work keeps
        using the convenient defaults. This is the safety net that stops a
        misconfigured deploy from shipping with:
          • a forgeable JWT_SECRET (anyone could mint a valid admin token),
          • a publicly-known ADMIN_API_KEY,
          • the Admin@123 seed password,
          • an unauthenticated MongoDB (anyone on the network could read
            wallets / overwrite the super-admin password hash),
          • debug tracebacks leaking internals to clients.
