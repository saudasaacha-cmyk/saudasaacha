"""Request / response schemas for the Employee-management surface.

Employees are staff sub-users of an admin (super or sub). They reuse the
existing ``AdminPermissions`` boolean-per-section model; the creating admin can
only grant sections they themselves hold (the ceiling is enforced server-side).
