"""Real market-data service — Zerodha (Indian) + Infoway (forex/crypto/etc).

NO mock/random-walk price generation. When no real feed is connected for
a token (Zerodha WS not subscribed AND Infoway not subscribed AND REST
snapshot unavailable), this service returns a zero-valued quote so the
UI clearly shows "—" for bid/ask/LTP instead of inventing fake prices.

Background tick loop publishes ticks ONLY when a real overlay updates
the cached quote — the loop no longer steps prices itself.

The service exposes:
    • get_ltp(token) → current price (Decimal); returns 0 if no feed
    • get_quote(token) → full quote shape (zeros when no feed)
    • subscribe(tokens) / unsubscribe(tokens) — in-memory tracking
    • tick_loop — publishes per-token ticks to Redis pub/sub for WS fanout.

    a single-core feed, stretching one pass to ~10 s → every published price
    (option chain, positions, risk enforcer's `mdlive`) was ~10 s stale.

    ``mdlive:{token}``.

    Why this exists: the boot/reconnect warm in ``zerodha_service`` subscribed
    held tokens on the Kite WS (so ``_state`` warms) but never added them to
    ``_subscribed``, so ``tick_loop`` skipped mirroring them into ``mdlive``.
    The sharded risk loop reads ``mdlive`` — so any held token nobody was
    independently watching (no watchlist entry / open chart) had NO live price
    and the risk enforcer silently SKIPPED SL/TP/stop-out for it every tick
    (the ``risk_ltp_fetch_failed`` flood). This reconciles BOTH registries.

    Idempotent: ``subscribe_tokens_on_demand`` skips already-subscribed Kite
    tokens and ``_subscribed`` is a set. Numeric tokens → Kite WS (warms
    ``_state``); symbol-style synthetic (Infoway forex/crypto) tokens are
    forwarded to the Infoway WS by ``subscribe`` below.
