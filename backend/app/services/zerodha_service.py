"""Zerodha Kite Connect integration.

Wraps the official `kiteconnect` Python SDK:
  • REST: login URL, generate session, instruments CSV, quotes, historical data
  • WebSocket (KiteTicker): live binary tick stream for subscribed instruments

The service runs as a singleton (`zerodha`). Live ticks are kept in an
in-memory `ticks_cache` dict keyed by symbol AND token, and pushed to Redis
pub/sub channels for WS fanout to user browsers.

        backend restart se hi hatti hai". Kite can invalidate a token
        BEFORE its nominal 08:00 IST expiry (e.g. login from another
        device, Kite-side rotation, IP block). Our `tokenExpiry` says
        future, but every WS upgrade now returns 403. The self-heal
        loop then loops endlessly with the dead token, holding the
        Kite-side WS slot warm and preventing fresh logins from
        succeeding cleanly.

        With this probe + auto-clear, the moment Kite says "this token
        is dead" we wipe accessToken from DB. The next loop iteration
        sees `not s.accessToken`, skips, and the auto-login scheduler
        (or admin click) gets a clean slate. No restart needed.

        Historical note — why this no longer uses ``kiteconnect.KiteTicker``
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        KiteTicker runs on Twisted's reactor, which is a process-global
        singleton that CANNOT be restarted once it stops
        (``ReactorNotRestartable``). After the daily 08:00 IST token
        rotation (or any teardown) the reactor thread would die, and every
        subsequent ``KiteTicker.connect()`` silently spawned a thread that
        died instantly — the socket never opened, ``on_connect``/``on_close``
        never fired, and the admin saw "Ticker: ERROR / Last close reason:
        (none)" forever. The ONLY recovery was a full backend restart (fresh
        reactor). That was the operator's daily pain.

        This implementation mirrors the proven ``bharat_indian_funded`` MERN
        approach: a plain WebSocket straight to ``wss://ws.kite.trade``
        driven on the asyncio event loop. No Twisted, no reactor, so it can
        be opened and closed as many times as needed within one process —
        self-heal and daily re-login now recover WITHOUT a restart.

        Returns the index of the new connection.

        back to zero.

        This method does the same three things a restart does, in
        order, without dropping the process:
          1. Stop any half-alive ticker.
          2. Reset the self-heal counter + un-pause the loop so the
             very next try uses the base interval.
          3. Refresh the captured asyncio main loop (the prior one
             may have been starved by overlay timeouts during the
             stuck window).
          4. Drive a fresh ``connect_ws(force=True)`` synchronously
             and return its outcome so the admin button can show a
             success / failure toast in one round-trip.

        Unlike `get_last_tick_age_sec` (which measures when WE received the
        frame, and is therefore fooled by the stale snapshot Kite resends on
        every (re)subscribe of a CLOSED-session instrument), this reads the
        exchange's own `exchange_timestamp`. A snapshot of a closed market
        carries the PREVIOUS session's timestamp, so this reports a large age
        even when the frame just landed — the reliable "is this session
        actually live" signal the order validator uses to reject pre-open /
        holiday-evening-session / mid-halt orders.

        Returns None when we have no tick OR the tick carries no usable
        exchange_timestamp — the caller then falls back to the received_at
        gate, so behaviour is never harder than before.
