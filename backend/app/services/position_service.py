    never closed open positions in that contract. The result was *zombie*
    positions: the risk-enforcer can never price a dead/unsubscribed token,
    so it silently SKIPS SL/TP/stop-out for them every tick
    (``risk_ltp_fetch_failed`` flood), the position sits OPEN forever and
    the user's margin stays locked. This settles the position once at the
    last-known price and releases that margin.

    Unlike ``weekly_settlement`` (which carries the exposure forward by
    re-opening a fresh row), this does NOT re-open — the contract is dead —
    and it DOES release the locked margin.

    Settlement-price selection (never books at 0):
      1. explicit ``settlement_price`` arg, else
      2. live LTP if the token still ticks (first day-after sweep), else
      3. the position's own frozen ``ltp`` (last-good tick before expiry).
    Returns ``"skipped"`` if no usable (>0) price exists so a later run can
    retry; ``"settled"`` on success; ``"failed"`` on error.

    Idempotent at the caller level: operates only on OPEN rows and flips
    status→CLOSED, so a repeat sweep won't double-book.

    Targeting (no Position→Trade FK exists): fills for the same
    (user, token, product_type) executed inside the position's
