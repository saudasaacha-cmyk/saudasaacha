# ── Open settle-buffer (stale-first-tick protection) ──────────────────
# At the exact opening bell the exchange's FIRST packet often carries a
# FRESH exchange_timestamp but a STALE / pre-open / unsettled price — the
# real opening trade prints a few seconds later. The live-tick freshness
# gate (§11b) waves it through because the timestamp IS fresh, so a user
# order could fill at that transient price. 2026-07-08 09:00 MCX: a
# CRUDEOIL BUY booked at a stale 6767 while the session actually opened
# ~6885, gifting ~₹21.6k phantom profit when squared off a minute later.
# We therefore refuse NEW USER orders (entry AND user-initiated exit) for
# the first _OPEN_SETTLE_BUFFER_SEC after a segment's daily open so the
# opening price establishes first. SERVER force-close (risk / admin / EOD)
# is exempt — and risk_enforcer independently suppresses stop-out/SL/TP for
# the SAME window (its _OPEN_GRACE_SEC), so during the buffer NEITHER side
# acts on the unsettled tick: fully symmetric, exploit-proof both ways.
# AMO orders are exempt (they queue for the open). Forex/crypto self-exempt
# — they have no daily bell, so is_within_open_grace() returns False.
# Keep this in lockstep with risk_enforcer._OPEN_GRACE_SEC.
