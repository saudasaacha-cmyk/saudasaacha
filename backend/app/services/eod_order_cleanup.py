"""End-of-day auto-cancel for parked DAY orders, per segment.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A LIMIT / SL-M order the user parks sits as ``OPEN`` and the
``pending_order_poller`` only ever *fires* it when its trigger is hit —
nothing ever *expires* it. So an unfilled order carried into the NEXT
trading day and fired on the next day's prices: the operator-reported
"pending order dusre din carry forward ho jaata hai" bug.

WHEN IT SWEEPS
--------------
Each settings row (Segment Settings) carries its own **pending order expiry
time** in IST, because a forex session ends nowhere near an NSE one. At that
time the row is swept once per IST day:

  • unfilled LIMIT / SL-M orders on its instruments are marked ``EXPIRED``
    and their blocked margin released;
  • positions carrying overnight lose their SL / TP (operator decision —
    brackets are day-scoped too). A carried position is therefore
    unprotected until the user sets them again.

A row with **no time set is never swept**, so its orders carry exactly as
they did before this was configurable. ``00:00`` reproduces the original
midnight sweep.

AMO HANDLING
------------
An AMO is placed in the evening FOR THE NEXT session, so it must survive the
sweep that immediately follows its placement. It is given exactly one
session: expired only once it is older than the START of the previous IST
day.

SAFETY / PLACEMENT
------------------
Mongo-only (no in-process price state), so it is safe on ANY worker and runs
under its OWN ``leader:eod_order_cleanup`` lock (NOT the ``leader:feed``
gate). Idempotent — a second run finds nothing left to expire.
