"""Infoway (infoway.io) WebSocket integration.

Infoway covers global markets that Kite Connect does not — forex pairs
(EURUSD, USDJPY…), crypto pairs (BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT…), spot metals
(XAUUSD, XAGUSD…) and energy (USOIL, UKOIL, NATGAS).

Protocol (code-based JSON over WS — different from AllTick):
    Subscribe          → {code: 10003, trace, data: {codes: "BTC,ETH,..."}}
    Unsubscribe        → {code: 10004, trace, data: {codes: "BTC,..."}}
    Server depth push  ← {code: 10005, data: {s, t,
                            a: [[prices], [volumes]],   # asks
                            b: [[prices], [volumes]]}}  # bids

Endpoints — Infoway splits markets onto separate WS channels:
    Crypto                  wss://data.infoway.io/ws?business=crypto&apikey=...
    Forex / metals / energy wss://data.infoway.io/ws?business=common&apikey=...

We hold both connections in parallel and fan-out subscriptions to whichever
channel matches the symbol's class. The public surface (`infoway.ticks`,
`infoway.subscribe`, `infoway.status`, …) is identical to the AllTick
service this replaces so callers don't change.

Every numeric field exposed downstream is `float`. Decimal coercion only
happens at the order / wallet boundary; the live tick path stays float so
it is cheap and JSON-serialisable for Redis fanout.

# 15 s (not 25 s) on purpose: the single backend event loop occasionally
# stalls for several seconds under a heavy risk-enforcer sweep, which DELAYS
# this heartbeat. At 25 s a couple of stalls could push the actual gap past

# fires) but the server has silently stopped pushing frames — the watchlist
# then freezes at 0.00 forever (operator/user report: "price bar-bar ruk
# jata hai"). If we go this long without ANY inbound frame (a tick OR any
# server ack — `_dispatch` sees every frame), force-close the socket so the
# receive loop unwinds and `_run_loop` reconnects + re-subscribes. 45 s = 3

# In practice this happens right after a backend restart: the PREVIOUS
# process's sockets are still lingering server-side and occupying the slot,
# so the new process is rejected. Backing off only 30 s keeps us rejected AND
# keeps the slot contended, so on a 429 we wait much longer (up to ~2 min) to

# within a few seconds — the server closing us with code 1000, a half-open
# heal, or a 429 that briefly slipped through — must KEEP ramping the backoff
# instead of resetting to 1 s. Without this, every quick drop reset us to a
# 1 s retry and we hammered Infoway straight back into an HTTP 429 storm, the
# reconnect churn behind the recurring "stale feed events" spikes. 30 s cleanly
# separates that churn (drops in <5 s) from a healthy connection that has done
