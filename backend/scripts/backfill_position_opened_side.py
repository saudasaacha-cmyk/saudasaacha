"""Backfill `opened_side` on positions that pre-date the field.

Before the fix, the Position document did NOT carry the opening direction
explicitly — the UI derived the side from `quantity > 0 ? BUY : SELL`. That
worked while the position was open but defaulted every fully-closed row
(quantity == 0) to SELL, so a closed BUY trade rendered as "SELL" on the
Closed tab.

The fix added an `opened_side` field that's stamped at insert / reopen /
flip and stays stable on close. This script back-populates that field for
every Position that doesn't have it yet:

  • For OPEN positions: derive from current `quantity` sign — it's accurate
    while the row is still open.
  • For CLOSED positions (quantity == 0): look up the earliest Trade row
    for the same (user, instrument.token, product_type) executed within
    [opened_at, closed_at] and use its action.

Idempotent — only writes when `opened_side` is currently None.

Run from the backend folder:

    cd /opt/saudasaacha/backend
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python -m scripts.backfill_position_opened_side

Dry-run preview (no writes):

    python -m scripts.backfill_position_opened_side --dry-run
